## Math

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).


## Tables

First, add the following to the post's front matter

```yml
pretty_table: true
```

Then, the following syntax

```markdown
| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1       |    center 1    |       right 1 |
| Left 2       |    center 2    |       right 2 |
| Left 3       |    center 3    |       right 3 |
```

will generate

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1       |    center 1    |       right 1 |
| Left 2       |    center 2    |       right 2 |
| Left 3       |    center 3    |       right 3 |


## Videos

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>


## Jupyter Notebook

To include a jupyter notebook in a post, you can use the following code:

{% raw %}

```liquid
{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = 'assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb' | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == 'true' %}
  {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
  <p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}
```

{% endraw %}

Let's break it down: this is possible thanks to [Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin](https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook) that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls [`jupyter nbconvert --to html`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html) to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since [Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/) is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the [::nomarkdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions) tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.

The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the `file_exists` filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}

Note that the jupyter notebook supports both light and dark themes.

## Citations

This post shows how to add bibliography to simple blog posts. We support every citation style that [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) does. That means simple citation like {% cite einstein1950meaning %}, multiple citations like {% cite einstein1950meaning einstein1905movement %}, long references like {% reference einstein1905movement %} or also quotes:

{% quote einstein1905electrodynamics %}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.
{% endquote %}

## Pseudocode

This is an example post with some pseudo code rendered by [pseudocode](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js). The example presented here is the same as the one in the [pseudocode.js](https://saswat.padhi.me/pseudocode.js/) documentation, with only one simple but important change: everytime you would use `$`, you should use `$$` instead. Also, note that the `pseudocode` key in the front matter is set to `true` to enable the rendering of pseudo code. As an example, using this code:

````markdown
```pseudocode
% This quicksort algorithm is extracted from Chapter 7, Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition)
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Quicksort}
\begin{algorithmic}
\PROCEDURE{Quicksort}{$$A, p, r$$}
    \IF{$$p < r$$}
        \STATE $$q = $$ \CALL{Partition}{$$A, p, r$$}
        \STATE \CALL{Quicksort}{$$A, p, q - 1$$}
        \STATE \CALL{Quicksort}{$$A, q + 1, r$$}
    \ENDIF
\ENDPROCEDURE
\PROCEDURE{Partition}{$$A, p, r$$}
    \STATE $$x = A[r]$$
    \STATE $$i = p - 1$$
    \FOR{$$j = p$$ \TO $$r - 1$$}
        \IF{$$A[j] < x$$}
            \STATE $$i = i + 1$$
            \STATE exchange
            $$A[i]$$ with $$A[j]$$
        \ENDIF
        \STATE exchange $$A[i]$$ with $$A[r]$$
    \ENDFOR
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```
````

Generates:

```pseudocode

\PROCEDURE{Quicksort}{$$A, p, r$$}

        \STATE $$q = $$ \CALL{Partition}{$$A, p, r$$}
        \STATE \CALL{Quicksort}{$$A, p, q - 1$$}
        \STATE \CALL{Quicksort}{$$A, q + 1, r$$}
    \ENDIF
\ENDPROCEDURE
\PROCEDURE{Partition}{$$A, p, r$$}
    \STATE $$x = A[r]$$
    \STATE $$i = p - 1$$
    \FOR{$$j = p$$ \TO $$r - 1$$}
        \IF{$$A[j] < x$$}
            \STATE $$i = i + 1$$
            \STATE exchange
            $$A[i]$$ with $$A[j]$$
        \ENDIF
        \STATE exchange $$A[i]$$ with $$A[r]$$
    \ENDFOR
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

## Code

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 \* bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

````markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
````

Which displays:

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}

## Images

This is an example post with image galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
