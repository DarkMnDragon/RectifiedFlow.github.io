The rectified flow algorithm is a major method for image and video generation nowadays, and has deep connections to diffusion models. Here, we provide a series of blog posts on flow and diffusion models. Alongside the blogs, we also release a comprehensive codebase that integrates flow and diffusion models (including using pretrained flow models like <a href="https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux?tab=readme-ov-file">Flux</a>) at the <a href="https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO">RectifiedFlow GitHub Repository</a>. The details about the derivations are provided in this <a href="#">book</a>. If you have questions regarding the posts, codebase, or the book, please contact us using this <a href="mailto:rectifiedflow@googlegroups.com">email</a>.
